## Log:

Currently following a Create a Blog course by freeCodeCamp.org - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj7HLsJenVg

The plan is today follow the course and on the following days rebuild it.

Current Tech:
Uses Swiper, an API for slides.

The 30-Day Challenge Blog is more or less completed. It still needs to be made more responsive on larger (desktop) sizes. For now, I would like to change pace to OOP, namely Java.

Even though I've worked professionally as a Java Developer, I've come to the realization that I have few Java projects on my github. Thus the next part of the challenge will be finding and completing a java project.

Currently working through a refresher CodeSpace Java course called "Practice It: Java" by Bethan Palmer on LinkedIn Learning.
